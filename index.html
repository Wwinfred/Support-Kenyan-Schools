    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are passionate about ensuring that every child in Kenya has access to quality education. Our mission is to bridge the gap in educational resources by linking schools in need with those who can support them.</p>
    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>
  We are a community of educators, students, volunteers, and global citizens committed to transforming learning environments in underserved Kenyan schools.
</p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>
  We connect supporters with real school needs—computers, books, dormitories, clean water, and more—making it easy for anyone to be part of a child’s success story.
</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>
  Quality education breaks the cycle of poverty. With your help, students not only stay in school, but also dream bigger, think brighter, and lead change in their communities.
</p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>
  Whether you donate, volunteer, or share our story—you become a vital part of this journey. Together, we can build classrooms of hope and halls of opportunity.
</p>
